I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://coss.fsu.edu/polisci/home" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>. Before joining FSU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="http://ncgg-new.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a> at  <a href="http://www.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>. I received my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.polisci.osu.edu" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a>.

I have research interests in international and comparative political economy, with a particular focus on the politics of financial globalization. My research examines why and how global capital mobility shapes politics and policymaking in emerging markets. I investigate the determinants of capital market responses to political events and national policies, paying close attention to multiple forms of contagion in the global political economy. Methodologically, I have interests in quantitative methods for the study of complex and dynamic interdependencies in international political economy data---such as multivariate time series analysis, spatial econometrics, and social network analysis.

<!--- I analyze contagion dynamics from domestic to international investors in capital market reactions to politics, diffusion processes in governments' decisions to default on sovereign debt, as well as contagion in market assessments of government creditworthiness induced by investors' use of decision heuristics. --->

<!--- I was a Senior Fellow in the <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/research/prism" target="_blank">Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM)</a> at Ohio State University and have methodological interests in quantitative methods for the study of complex and dynamic interdependencies in political economy data, such as multivariate time series analysis, spatial econometrics, and social network analysis. --->

<!--- Prior to joining OSU, I was a Policy Analyst/Advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Finance, where I worked on the negotiation of international agreements on trade and investment in multilateral, regional, and bilateral forums, such as the WTO, OECD, and Mercosur. --->
